The original code for "Tensor Networks for Machine Learning" article is written in ITensor library around 2016. By 2024, many features of ITensor library are depreciated. Hence, the original code is not working. Hence, I corrected and updated some depreciated features in the code, only "FixedL.cc" (see https://github.com/emstoudenmire/TNML/tree/master). To run fixedL.cc code, please follow the original GitHub instruction and then only change "fixedL.cc" file.
